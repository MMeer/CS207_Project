# CS207_Project
## An Arduino Mini Game Console

This Github repository was created for Computer Science 207. In this class we have to recreate an existing Arduino project and maintain a Github repository with all related files.

For our project we decided to combine two projects into one. The projects are: 

- https://www.hackster.io/Homer/arduino-web-based-car-race-brick-game-cb1b30
- https://www.hackster.io/khanhhs/arduino-web-based-two-player-game-584daa

The folders Default PHP Code and Default Arduino Code contains code from the above projects. All credit goes to the respective authors from those projects.
